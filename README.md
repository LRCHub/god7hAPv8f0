[00:16.87] Dance, boogie wonderland
[00:24.69] Dance, boogie wonderland

[00:41.63] To a woman who has laid too many bets
[00:46.78] The mirror stares you in the face and says
[01:07.78] 
[00:51.45] "Baby, uh uh, it don't work"
[00:53.94] You say your prayers, though you don't care
[00:57.60] You dance and shake the hurt
